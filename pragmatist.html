<p>Pragmatists are keen on trying out ideas, theories and techniques to see if they work in practice.
They positively search out new ideas and take the first opportunity to experiment with applications.
They are the sorts of people who return from management courses brimming with new ideas that they want to try out in practice.
They like to get on with things and act quickly and confidently on ideas that attract them. They tend to be impatient
with ruminating and open-ended discussions. They are essentially practical, down to earth	pile who like making practical
decisions and solving problems. They respond to problems and opportunities "as a challenge".
Their philosophy is: "There is always a better way" and "if it works it's good".</p>

<p>Pragmatists <strong>learn best</strong> from activities where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is an obvious link between the subject matter and a problem or opportunity on the job.</li>
    <li>They are shown techniques for doing things with obvious practical advantages, i.e. how to save time, how to make a good first impression, how to deal with awkward people.</li>
    <li>They have the chance to try out and practice techniques with coaching/feedback from a credible expert, i.e. someone who is successful and can do the techniques themselves.</li>
    <li>They are exposed to a model they can emulate, i.e. a respected boss, a demonstration from someone with a proven track record, lots of examples/anecdotes, and a film showing how itâ€™s done.</li>
    <li>They are given techniques currently applicable to their own job.</li>
    <li>They are given immediate opportunities to implement what they have learned.</li>
    <li>There is a high face validity in the learning activity, i.e. a good simulation, 'real" problems.</li>
    <li>They can concentrate on practical issues, i.e. drawing up action plans with an obvious end product, suggesting short cuts, giving tips.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pragmatists <strong>learn least</strong> from, and may react against, activities where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The learning is not related to an immediate need they recognize/they cannot see, an immediate relevance/practical benefit.</li>
    <li>Organizers of the learning, or the event itself, seems distant from reality, i.e. "ivory towered", all theory and general principles, pure "chalk and talk".</li>
    <li>There is no practice or clear guidelines on how to do it.</li>
    <li>They feel that people are going round in circles and not getting anywhere fast enough.</li>
    <li>There are political, managerial or personal obstacles to implementation.</li>
    <li>There is no apparent reward from the learning activity, i.e. more sales, shorter meetings, higher bonus, promotion.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary of strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Keen to test things out in practice.</li>
    <li>Practical, down to earth, realistic.</li>
    <li>Businesslike - gets straight to the point.</li>
    <li>Technique oriented.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary of weaknesses:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Tendency to reject anything without an obvious application.</li>
    <li>Not very interested in theory or basic principles.</li>
    <li>Tendency to seize on the first expedient solution to a problem.</li>
    <li>Impatient with waffle.</li>
    <li>On balance, task oriented not people oriented.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Will there be ample opportunities to practice and experiment?</li>
    <li>Will there be lots of practical tips and techniques?</li>
    <li>Shall we be addressing real problems and will it result in action plans to tackle some of my current problems?</li>
    <li>Shall we be exposed to experts who know how to/can do it themselves?</li>
</ul>
