<p>Reflectors like to stand back to ponder experiences and observe them from many different perspectives.
They collect data, both first hand and from others, and prefer to think about it thoroughly before coming to any conclusion.
The thorough collection and analysis of data about experiences and events is what counts so they tend to
postpone reaching definitive conclusions for as long as possible. Their philosophy is to be cautious.
They are thoughtful people who like to consider all possible angles and implications before making a move.
They prefer to take a back seat in meetings and discussions. They enjoy observing other people in action.
They listen to others and get the drift of the discussion before making their own points. They tend to adopt
a low profile and have a slightly distant, tolerant unruffled air about them. When they act it is part of a
wide picture which includes the past as well as the present and others' observations as well as their own.</p>

<p>Reflectors <strong>learn best</strong> from activities where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They are allowed or encouraged to watch/think/chew over activities.</li>
    <li>They are able to stand back From events and listen/observe, i.e. observing a group at work, taking a back seat in a meeting, watching a film or video.</li>
    <li>They are allowed to think before acting, to assimilate before commencing, i.e. time to prepare, a chance to read in advance a brief giving background data.</li>
    <li>They can carry out some painstaking research, i.e. investigate, assemble information, and probe to get to the bottom of things.</li>
    <li>They have the opportunity to review what has happened, what they have learned.</li>
    <li>They are asked to produce carefully considered analyses and reports.</li>
    <li>They are helped to exchange views with other people without danger, i.e. by prior agreement, within a structured learning experience.</li>
    <li>They can reach a decision in their own time without pressure and tight deadlines.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reflectors <strong>learn least</strong> from, and may react against, activities where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They are "forced" into the limelight, i.e. to act as leader/chairman, to role-play in front of on-lookers.</li>
    <li>They are involved in situations which require action without planning.</li>
    <li>They are pitched into doing something without warning, i.e. to produce an instant reaction, to produce an off-the-top-of-the-head idea.</li>
    <li>They are given insufficient data on which to base a conclusion.</li>
    <li>They are given cut and dried instructions of how things should be done.</li>
    <li>They are worried by time pressures or rushed from one activity to another.</li>
    <li>In the interests of expediency they have to make short cuts or do a superficial job.</li>
