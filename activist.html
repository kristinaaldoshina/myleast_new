<p >Activists involve themselves fully and without bias in new experiences.
They enjoy the here and now and are happy to be dominated by immediate experiences.
They are open-minded, not sceptic, and this tends to make them enthusiastic about anything new.
Their philosophy is: "I'll try anything once". They tend to act first and consider the consequences afterwards.
Their days are filled with activity. They tackle problems by brainstorming.
As soon as the excitement from one activity has died down they are busy looking for the next.
They tend to thrive on the challenge of new experiences but are bored with implementation and longer-term consolidation.
They are gregarious people constantly involving themselves with others but in doing so;
they seek to centre all activities on themselves.</p>

<p>Activists <strong>learn best</strong> from activities where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are new experiences (problems, opportunities) from which to learn.</li>
    <li>They can engross themselves in short "here and now" activities such as business games, competitive teamwork tasks, role-playing exercises.</li>
    <li>There is excitement/drama/crisis and things chop and change with a range of diverse activities to tackle.</li>
    <li>They have a lot of the limelight/high visibility, i.e. they can "chair" meetings, lead discussions, and give presentations.</li>
    <li>They are allowed to generate ideas without constraints of policy or structure or feasibility.</li>
    <li>They are thrown in at the deep end with a task they think is difficult, i.e. when set a challenge with inadequate resources and adverse conditions.</li>
    <li>They are involved with other people, i.e. bouncing ideas off them, solving problems as part of a team.</li>
    <li>It is appropriate to "have a go".</li>
</ul>

<p>Activists <strong>learn least</strong> from, and may react against, activities where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learning involves a passive role, i.e. listening to lectures, monologues, explanations, statements of how things should be done, reading, watching.</li>
    <li>They are asked to stand back and not be involved.</li>
    <li>They are required to assimilate, analyse and interpret lots of "messy" data.</li>
    <li>They are required to engage in solitary work, i.e. reading, writing, thinking on their own.</li>
    <li>They are asked to assess beforehand what they will learn, and to appraise afterwards what they have learned.</li>
    <li>They are offered statements they see as "theoretical", i.e. explanation of cause or background</li>
    <li>They are asked to repeat essentially the same activity over and over again, i.e. when practicing.</li>
    <li>They have precise instructions to follow with little room for manoeuvre.</li>
    <li>They are asked to do a thorough job, i.e. attend to detail, tie up loose ends, dot the i's, cross t's.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary of strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Flexible and open minded.</li>
    <li>Happy to have a go.</li>
    <li>Happy to be exposed to new situations.</li>
    <li>Optimistic about anything new and therefore unlikely to resist change.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary of weaknesses:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Tendency to take the immediately obvious action without thinking.</li>
    <li>Often take unnecessary risks.</li>
    <li>Tendency to do too much themselves and hog the limelight.</li>
    <li>Rush into action without sufficient preparation.</li>
    <li>Get bored with implementation/consolidation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Shall I learn something new, i.e. that I didn't know/couldn't do before?</li>
    <li>Will there be a wide variety of different activities? (I don't want to sit and listen for more than an hour at a stretch!)</li>
    <li>Will it be OK to have a go/let my hair down/make mistakes/have fun?</li>
    <li>Shall I encounter some tough problems and challenges?</li>
    <li>Will there be other like-minded people to mix with?</li>
</ul>
