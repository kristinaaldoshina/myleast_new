<p>Auditory learning is a learning style in which an individual learns through listening. An auditory learner depends on
hearing and speaking as the primary style of learning. Auditory learners must be able to hear what is being said in
order to understand and may have difficulty with instructions that are written. They also use their listening and
repeating skills to sort through the information that is sent to them.</p>

<p><strong>Prevalence:</strong></p>
<p>Making up about 30% of the population, auditory learners absorb information best through the sense of hearing.</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<p>They may struggle to understand a chapter they have read, but then experience a full understanding as they listen to
the class lecture. They have the ability to follow verbal instructions readily and prefer to hear information rather than
read it. With a tendency to adopt a theoretical style of learning, they need to understand small parts and the
relationships between these parts in order to create a bigger picture and gain a deeper understanding. An auditory
learner is skill oriented, memorizes tasks well and benefits from traditional styles of teaching /lectures/ question and
answer sessions.While they are able to orally communicate well, they may have difficulty communicating in written form. Auditory
learners are good at writing responses to lectures they have heard. They are also good at oral exams and learn
effectively by listening to information delivered orally, in lectures, speeches, and oral sessions. They may be reluctant
to make their own notes or conduct personal research and may prefer delivering presentations to a written report.
Auditory learners tend to have a knack for ascertaining the true meaning of someone's words by listening to audible
signals like changes in tone. When memorizing a phone number, an auditory learner will say it out loud and then
remember how it sounded to recall it. They tend to recall accurately what has been spoken, but may gain little benefit
from additional reading or writing out facts. They enjoy explaining their learning to others in the group and learn from
discussion. Proponents claim that when an auditory/ verbal learner reads, it is almost impossible for the learner to comprehend
anything without sound in the background. In these situations, listening to music or having different sounds in the
background (TV, people talking, etc.) will help learners work better.</p>
