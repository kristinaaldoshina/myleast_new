<p> Modern learning paradigm states that all participants of a learning process (learner, teacher, parents/relatives, etc.)
have to encourage the learner to create and lead his own learning process. Modern society aknowledges, that people learn differently,
and those differences depend on many factors, like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>age,</li>
  <li>previous experiences,</li>
  <li>physical environment,</li>
  <li>social environment,</li>
  <li>emotional state,</li>
  <li>physiology,</li>
  <li>and etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Influence of these factors forms person's learning style - the totality of various human qualities and environmental
factors that stimulate (or help) a person to concentrate on learning. It means, that if a learner knows his learning style, he can learn in the most efficient way and
achieve stunning results. There is no the best learning style - each one has advantages.
</p>

<p >Nowadays many different learning theories suggest various classifications of learning styles (click on "Nature of Learning" below to find out more).
We suggest you to concentrate on Honey-Mumford's and Fleming's theories, which are easy to understand
and easy to apply by any participant of a learning process.</p>

<p>In 1986 Peter Honey and Alan Mumford identified four distinct learning styles, based on
at which stage a learner starts his learning process (see picture below). You can find out more by clicking on
"Honey and Mumford Learning Styles" below.</p>

<p >In 1987 Neil Fleming defined three learning styles, based on what modality preferences (visual, auditory or kinaesthetic) dominate
in a learner's communication. You can find out more by clicking on "Fleming's VAK Learning Styles" below.</p>

<p>It is newer to late to become a successful learner: just complete HM test and VAK tests to find out your preferable learning style(s) and recommendations for efficient learning!</p>

<p> Usually a person has no a single dominant learning style,
that is why after completing tests you will see distributions of how strongly each style appears in you.</p>

<p>Please note, that both <strong>tests have no option to save your choices to continue later</strong>, 
but you can download results (descriptions) after a test is completed.</p>
