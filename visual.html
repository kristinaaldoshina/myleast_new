<p>Visual learning is a teaching and learning style in which ideas, concepts, data and other information are associated with
images and techniques. It is one of the three basic types of learning styles in the widely-used Fleming VAK/ VARK model.</p>

<p><strong>Prevalence:</strong></p>
<p>Making up about 60%-65% of the general population, visual learners absorb and recall information best by seeing.</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<p>Individuals who prefer this style of learning are those who learn through seeing things. They prefer to see information
& instructions and may forget information that has only been heard. With the ability to visualize, they tend to see
pictures and images when they remember things and may use mind maps. They have a predisposition for writing,
drawing, imagining and prefer to create their own notes and to read for themselves.
They have an inclination to see a concept as whole rather than individual parts. They benefit from seeing the aims and
objectives of learning sessions or from understanding the purpose of the session. Relying heavily on their senses and
enjoying working in groups where they observe non-verbal cues from colleagues, they learn through role play and
watching others perform or demonstrate a skill. Moreover, they also tend to have good control over sign language.
While visual learners tend to be good at spelling, they may forget names. Preferring a less formal setting to learn, a
traditional classroom environment may not be highly beneficial to them. They are usually organized and observant but
can be distracted by movement of others when they are trying to concentrate. With a tendency to daydream while
reading, they are likely to visualize what they are hearing. Visual Learners tend to be fascinated with colour and have
the ability to understand complex maps, graphs and charts. Hence, they may use colour coding, diagrams and symbols
to revise and help recall, or by re-writing pieces of text or other information in their own style.</p>
