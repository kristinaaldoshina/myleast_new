<p>Theorists adapt and integrate observations into complex but logically sound theories.
They think problems through in a vertical, step-by-step logical way.
They assimilate disparate facts into coherent theories.
They tend to be perfectionists who won't rest easy until things are tidy and fit into a rational scheme.
They like to analyze and synthesize. They are keen on basic assumptions, principles,
theories models and systems thinking. Their philosophy prizes rationality and logic.
"If it's logical it's good". Questions they frequently ask are: "Does it make sense?"
"How does this fit with that?" "What are the basic assumptions?" They tend to be detached,
analytical and dedicated to rational objectivity rather than anything subjective or ambiguous.
Their approach to problems is consistently logical. This is their "mental set" and they rigidly
reject anything that doesn't fit with it. They prefer to maximize certainty and feel uncomfortable
with subjective judgments, lateral thinking and anything flippant.</p>

<p>Theorists <strong>learn best</strong> from activities where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What is being offered is part of a system, model, concept, theory.</li>
    <li>They can analyze and then generalize the reasons for success or failure.</li>
    <li>The have time to explore methodically the associations and inter-relationships between ideas, events and situations.</li>
    <li>They are offered interesting ideas and concepts even though they are not immediately relevant.</li>
    <li>They have the chance to question and probe the basic methodology, assumptions or logic behind something, i.e. by taking part in a question and answer session, by checking a paper for inconsistencies.</li>
    <li>They are intellectually stretched, i.e. by analyzing a complex situation, being tested in a tutorial session, by teaching high calibre people who ask searching questions.</li>
    <li>They are in structured situations with a clear purpose.</li>
    <li>They can listen to or read about ideas and concepts that emphasize rationality or logic and are well argued/elegant/watertight.</li>
    <li>They are required to understand and participate in complex situations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Theorists <strong>learn least</strong> from, and may react against, activities where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They are pitch-forked into doing something without a context or apparent purpose.</li>
    <li>They have to participate in situations emphasizing emotions and feelings.</li>
    <li>They are involved in unstructured activities where ambiguity and uncertainty are high, i.e. with openÂ¬ended problems, on sensitivity training.</li>
    <li>They are asked to act or decide without a basis in policy, principle or concept.</li>
    <li>They are faced with a hotchpotch of alternative/contradictory techniques/methods without exploring any in depth, i.e. as on a "once over lightly" course.</li>
    <li>They feel themselves out of tune with other participants, i.e. when with lots of Activists or people of lower intellectual calibre.</li>
    <li>They find the subject matter platitudinous, shallow or gimmicky.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary of strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Logical "vertical" thinkers.</li>
    <li>Rational and objective.</li>
    <li>Good at asking probing questions.</li>
    <li>Disciplined approach.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary of weaknesses:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Restricted in lateral thinking.</li>
    <li>Low tolerance for uncertainty, disorder and ambiguity.</li>
    <li>Intolerant of anything subjective or intuitive.</li>
    <li>Full of "shoulds, oughts and musts".</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Will there be lots of opportunities to question?</li>
    <li>Do the objectives and program of events indicate a clear structure and purpose?</li>
    <li>Shall I encounter complex ideas and concepts that are likely to stretch me?</li>
    <li>Are the approaches to be used and concepts to be explored "respectable", i.e. sound and valid?</li>
    <li>Shall I be with people of similar calibre to myself?</li>
</ul>
